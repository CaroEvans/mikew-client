- Log in and out of their account securely

- Get an idea of our client’s services

- View our client’s contact details

- Make and cancel bookings (within a reasonable time frame)

### Github

An organization was created on github under Global-Worldwide-Synergetic-Solutions. In there we have the master repository for our client and server application, these will serve as the production source code for the project. Team members will fork from these repositories and create feature branches from their fork.

![git flow](./assests/gitflow.png)

Each feature being developed will be on a feature branch, when done merge with your fork , then open pull request on master.

For back end, ensure all continuous integration tests pass on your fork before opening a pull requests.

For front end  after making a pull request another team member will do a code review to make sure everything looks good then accepts the pull requests and merges with master.
